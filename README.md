# -BeagleBone-Black
This is an attempt to restructure the schematics of the Beaglebone black as well as bring to Rev C with fixes for PHY reset from the latest Altium files which were at rev A5.

Todo:
* Combine the processor blocks into a single block.
* Incorporate the added components onto the PCB.
* Improve the power up sequencing.
